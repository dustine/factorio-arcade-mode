# Factorio Arcade Mode

Based on [this suggested game mode/scenario](https://www.reddit.com/r/factorio/comments/7eibzw/mod_idea_arcade_mode).

## To-Do

- In-game menu for setting resources
- Re-add the override option (for modpacks)
- Upgrading
- Overhead counter of charges?
- Add support for custom loaders (the fastest loader wins)
- Balancing
  - Research tiers for more spawners (red-red/green-...)
  - Failsafe resource detector
- Better graphics!
- Security
  - Make sure resources can only be globally set by admins
- Documentation
- Better localisation
