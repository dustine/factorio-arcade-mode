# Factorio Arcade Mode

Based on [this suggested game mode/scenario](https://www.reddit.com/r/factorio/comments/7eibzw/mod_idea_arcade_mode).

## To-Do

- Infinity containers don't auto-gen (lag?)
- Overhead counter of charges?
- Add support for custom loaders/belts
- Balancing
  - Research tiers for more spawners (red-red/green-...)
  - Add compat to popular mods
    - Arcade Mode: Seablock Edition
    - RSO presets
- Better graphics!
- Security
  - Make sure resources can only be globally set by admins
- Documentation
- Better localisation

## Wishlist

- Start the player with a water tank?
- Instead of free starting power, an accumulator
- Store other items and output them with sources
- Tower defence mechanics

## Bugs (too tired to use github, sorry)
1. Research uses the current charges, adding WAY too many if you're using any
2. Seed 2987409364 has a lot of gaps and misplayed tiles...
